# Architecture Decision Records introduction

The project uses ADRs to document architectural decisions. The ADRs are stored in the `adr` directory. The structure
(sections) of the documents is currently not standardized as the project is still in the early stages of development.

Markdown is chosen as the format for the documents as it's widely used and rendered natively by GitHub which is helpful
especially in cases when a document includes images.
