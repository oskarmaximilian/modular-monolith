# Core libraries and frameworks used in the project

The selection of libraries and frameworks used in the project is highly opinionated as running analysis of popular libraries
and frameworks would be too time-consuming. But the chosen libraries meet very important criteria:
- enable writing clean code with separation between different layers of the application
- they are widely used and have a large community
- they are well documented
- they are actively developed

# Chosen libraries and frameworks

- FastAPI + Pydantic - web framework
- Gunicorn + Uvicorn - web server
- SQLAlchemy + Alembic - ORM
- Pytest - testing framework
- pip-tools - dependency management
